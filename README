This is a project around a web page that provides banking services. 

Front end:
an incoming client can
- register, login, and see his information
- transfer funds to other users
- partake in loaning services (by browing and posting). 

(*loaning services is a term referring to a special service, where a user can either request or provide funding, to or from, other users)


Back end:
- users and transactions are linked with a postgreSQL db
- loaning services are stored in a SQLite db 
- admins can request user info to detect suspicious behaviors
- url-based REST(like) api, providing the latest N transactions


Needs some adjustments but for the most part is functional
